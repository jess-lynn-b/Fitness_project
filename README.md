# FitnessApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.7.

## Overview

My Fitness Journal makes tracking your daily caloric intake and activity easy. You can log your meals and snacks, which can help you stay mindful of your nutrition choices. The food log component makes it simple to keep track of your meals and snacks, while the activity tracker feature enables you to log your daily exercise. You can also calculate your recommended caloric intake based on your individual information. The app utilizes the Harris-Benedict equation to take into account your activity level, age, weight, and gender to provide you with a tailored caloric recommendation. In addition to tracking, My Fitness Journal also lets you keep notes on the foods you eat, allowing you to reflect on your dietary choices and identify patterns that contribute to your overall well-being. You can stay organized and gain insights into your nutrition habits with this valuable feature. By allowing you to track your food consumption and physical activity on a daily basis, our app provides a holistic picture of your habits that can be used to support your health and put you on the right path to achieving your wellness goals.
